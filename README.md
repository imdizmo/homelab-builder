# Homelab Builder

Homelab Builder is a comprehensive, interactive web application designed to simplify the process of planning and architecting home laboratory infrastructure. It provides users with a visual interface to design network topologies, receive intelligent hardware recommendations based on their self-hosting needs, and generate actionable shopping lists.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Visual Network Builder
The core of the application is a visual canvas powered by **ReactFlow**.
- **Drag-and-drop hardware nodes**: Routers, switches, servers, NAS, Mini-PCs, SBCs (like Raspberry Pi), UPS, and more.
- **Wire components**: Graph-based representation of physical and logical connections.
- **Nested Virtualization**: Define Virtual Machines (VMs), Containers, or LXCs directly on compute nodes.
- **Real-time Synchronization**: The visual state is continuously synchronized with a PostgreSQL database.

### 2. Automated IP Management (`hlbIPAM`)
A sophisticated backend microservice manages network addressing:
- **Microservice Architecture for Scaling**: Built as a completely independent, stateless Go service. IP allocation requires heavy graph traversal and subnet math; isolating it means we can horizontally scale the IPAM workers seamlessly under high load without dragging down the main API server.
- **Topology-Aware BFS**: Automatically assigns IP addresses by performing a Breadth-First Search from the gateway.
- **Dynamic Pool Sizing**: Intelligently packs VM-hosting devices into separate pools without collisions.
- **Conflict Prevention**: Handles custom IP assignments and avoids DHCP range overlaps.

### 3. Service Catalog & Hardware Recommendations
- **Comprehensive Catalog**: Browse popular homelab services with pre-defined resource requirements.
- **3-Tier Suggestions**: Generates "Minimal", "Recommended", and "Optimal" hardware profiles.
- **Live Resource Dashboard**: Calculates aggregate CPU, RAM, Storage, and Power needs to ensure hardware can handle the concurrent load.

### 4. Actionable Shopping List
- **Itemized Components**: Automatically generates a shopping list including main hardware and necessary peripherals (RAM, NVMe, etc.).
- **Price Estimation**: Provides estimated costs with direct purchase links based on your region.
