# Contributing to HLBuilder

First, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

## Development Setup

1. Fork the repository (or clone it if you have write access)
2. Set up the environment variables (`cp .env.example .env`)
3. Spin up the development environment using Docker:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

## Branching Strategy

We use a two-branch model:

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `master` | Stable, release-ready code. **Never push directly to master.** |
| `dev` | Integration branch. All feature/fix branches are merged here first. |

### Workflow

```
master (stable releases)
  ↑ merge (maintainer only)
dev (integration / staging)
  ↑ pull request
feature/your-feature-name  ← you work here
```

1. **Start from `dev`** — always branch off the latest `dev`:
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   git checkout -b feature/short-description
   ```

2. **Work on your branch** — make commits with clear messages. Keep the scope small (one feature or fix per branch).

3. **Push and open a Pull Request into `dev`**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/short-description
   ```
   Then open a PR on GitHub targeting the **`dev`** branch (not `master`).

4. **PR review & merge** — once CI passes and the PR is approved, it gets merged into `dev`.

5. **Releases** — the maintainer periodically merges `dev` into `master` to cut a release.

### Branch Naming Convention

Use a descriptive prefix:

| Prefix | Use for |
|--------|---------|
| `feature/` | New functionality (e.g., `feature/add-vlan-support`) |
| `fix/` | Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/ip-collision-on-dual-router`) |
| `docs/` | Documentation-only changes (e.g., `docs/update-readme`) |
| `refactor/` | Code restructuring with no behavior change |
| `test/` | Adding or updating tests |

## Pull Request Process

We strictly follow a "One PR = One Feature/Fix" philosophy to keep reviews fast and code stable.

1. **Target branch: `dev`** — all PRs must target `dev`, not `master`.
2. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
3. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable.
4. Your PR must pass all GitHub Action CI tests before it can be merged.
5. If you have modified backend service logic, you MUST write an accompanying test in `*_test.go`.
6. Keep PRs focused — avoid mixing unrelated changes in a single PR.
